### IMPORTANT:

This project has Firestore integration, so you must first run the following commands to ensure the project compiles:

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This command creates the generated files that parse each Record from Firestore into a schema object.

### Getting started continued:

The Offical Dev Build for PLACE (c)
